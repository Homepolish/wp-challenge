Homepolish WordPress Challenge
----

## Methodology

This challenge is an attempt to replicate a real world project that an engineer
would encounter at Homepolish. The test is in two parts: the first part asks
you to convert a hi-res design image to HTML/CSS/JS, and the second part tests
WordPress specific knowledge.

As a candidate, you get an idea of what kind of work you will be doing
at Homepolish, while we have an opportunity to see how you approach a task.

Thanks for taking the time to go through this process!

**Important:** Try to timebox your work to 4 hours. You might not finish and that's ok. Just do as much as you can.

## What You're building

Homepolish has two types of users: clients and service professionals (designers,
contractors, etc.) We show service professional profiles so that clients can get a
sense of a designer's—for example—body of work and style.

### Requirements

#### Convert an Image

Convert the "About" section of the image (below) to HTML/CSS/JS.
* Use whatever libraries and tools you are familiar with and that work well
  within the WordPress eco-system.
* Build in any behavior that you think makes sense that is not defined in the
  feature set above. If you don't have time for everything, that's ok.
* Match the labels and substitute lorem ipsum for the content.
* Icon files can be found in `/public/images`
* Clicking "Portfolio" and "Reviews" should navigate to anchor tags below the
  "About" section. It is not necessary to implement those sections in full, but
  bonus points for making the attempt.
* Provide documentation where applicable or where you were unable to finish something.

#### Illustrate your WordPress Knowledge

Write a widget for a WordPress site that will contain links to the site owner’s
Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn profiles. The user must be allowed to specify
their usernames for those sites when adding the widget in the WordPress
back-end. You can provide a front-end design for the widget, but it is not required.

## Submission

Push your finished work to a **private** repository. Bitbucket is free for this and an ideal place to push your code. When you're done, please give the following emails access to your repository:

## Tips

* Try as best as you can to match the design. While the font family wont match exactly as a premium font was used in the mockup, the other elements can all be created with CSS.
* Don't focus on browser support for this project.
* Don't worry about media queries or adapting the layout. It is outside the scope of this project.
